<!-- ### Biography -->
I am a DPhil student at University of Oxford. 
The goal of my research is to solve sequential decision making problems in an efficient, scalable, and reliable way.
Currently, I focus on off-policy and offline reinforcement learning as a solution method.
My work won the best paper award at AAMAS and my research is funded by an EPSRC studentship.
I spent some time at Microsoft Research and DeepMind during my DPhil.

<!-- working with Prof. [Shimon Whiteson](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) under an [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) studentship.  -->
<!-- Before coming to Oxford, Shangtong did his master's degree with Prof. [Richard S. Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/) at University of Alberta and obtained his bachelor's degree from Fudan University. -->
<!-- Shangtong has broad interests in reinforcement learning, especially off-policy learning and temporal abstraction.  -->
